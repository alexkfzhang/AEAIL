# Auto-Encoding Adversarial Imitation Learning

Here is the code for our paper:
  
      Kaifeng Zhang, Rui Zhao, Ziming Zhang and Yang Gao. "Auto-Encoding Adversarial Imitation Learning".

The experiments are divided into two phases, phase 1 is based on DMControl (both state and image envs) with DrQ-v2 agent, phase 2 is based on MuJoCo with TRPO agent. 

Pls find the README.md in the repo for using the data and code, respectively.
