# Auto-Encoding Adversarial Imitation Learning

Here is the code for our paper:

      @article{aeail,
            author    = {Zhang, Kaifeng and Zhao, Rui and Zhang, Ziming and Gao, Yang},
            title     = {Auto-Encoding Adversarial Imitation Learning},
            year      = {2023},
      }

The experiments are divided into two phases:
  
      phase 1 is based on DMControl (both state and image envs) with DrQ-v2 agent
      
      phase 2 is based on MuJoCo with TRPO agent. 
      

Pls find the README.md in the repo for using the data and code, respectively.
